      	Configuration is a project to provide a generic Configuration
      	interface and allow the source of the
        values to vary.  It 
      	provides easy typed access to single, as well as lists of 
      	configuration values based on a 'key':
<source><![CDATA[
	Double double = Configuration.getDouble("some_double_value");
]]></source>      	
      </p>
      <p>
		Right now you can load properties from a simple properties file, 
		a properties file in a jar, an XML file, JNDI settings, as well as use
        a mix different sources using a ConfigurationFactory and CompositeConfiguration.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Custom configuration objects are very easy to create now by just subclassing 
      	AbstractConfiguration.  This works similar to how AbstractList works.

      <p>
        This code originated in JServ, was brought into Turbine,
        moved to Velocity and improved, and then moved into the
        Commons as ExtendedProperties. The code in
        ExtendedProperties is a little unwieldly and deals
        specifically with properties files.  Eventually it was added to
        the Commons sandbox project.
