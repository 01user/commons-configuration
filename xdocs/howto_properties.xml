    <section name="Steps for loading a properties file">
    	<p>
    		This section contains some very simple examples of configuration
    		files and demonstrates how the properties defined there can be
    		read from Java code.
    	</p>
    	<subsection name="A simple properties file">
    		<p>
    			At first lets consider that the whole configuration data of an
    			application consists of a single properties file named 
    			<code>usergui.properties</code> with the following content:
    		</p>
    			<source>
<![CDATA[
#Properties definining the GUI
colors.background=#FFFFFF
]]>
				</source>
			<p>
				Note that this file complies to the typical format of
				properties files.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can also have in a simple properties file various characters
				that are typically escaped like \n, \t etc:
			</p>
    			<source>
<![CDATA[
#Unescaped string that will be escaped
test.unescape = This \n string \t contains \" escaped \\ characters
]]>
				</source>
