              Commons Configuration requires Java 1.4 or later.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the maven POM a lot of dependencies are declared. These are all
              needed during compile time. On runtime however you only need to
              add the dependencies to your classpath that are required by the
              parts of the Commons Configuration package you are using. The
              following table helps you to determine which dependencies you
              have to include based on the components you intend to use:

                <li>Commons Configuration makes use of other
                Commons components. You should be able to use the current
                versions of these components together with Commons Configuration.
                In some cases, when no specific features are used, older
                versions will work, too. Below is a table with the version
                numbers that have been tested:

                  Java 1.4 comes with XML support. If you use only standard
                  features (e.g. loading XML documents with
                  <code>XMLConfiguration</code>), no additional dependencies are
                  needed. However, some modern features like schema validation
                  are not supported by the parser shipped with Java 1.4. On
                  Java 1.5 or higher this is not a problem; here everything
                  works out of the box. With Java 1.4 you need further libraries
                  to make these advanced features working. We used
