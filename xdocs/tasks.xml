        The following is a list of items that need to be completed in
        Configuration.  Contributions are welcome!

    <subsection name="High priority"> 
      <ul>
        <li>Using XML based digester rules will probably blow this bugger
            apart.  You do need a factory from an inner class of the
            Configuration factory to get the base Path right; even if 
            the test with the rule configuration file works, I'm pretty
            sure that the resulting rule set will not read configuration
            files if you're not running from the current (".") directory
            as base path. This needs more thinking and checking.</li>

        <li>I'm also 99% sure that using XML based Digester rules and
            Namespace awareness in the configuration file can't be used
            together. As far as I can see, the namespace awareness must
            be set/reset before the rules are added. In the case of the
            DigestLoader (using a DigesterRules() URI), the rules are 
            already added when configureNamespace() is called on the
            digester. This might even be a bug in the Digester itself.

       <ul>
          <li>
              <strong>JDBC Integration</strong>
              Need to be able to retrieve configuration values from JDBC 
              datasource.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>JDBC backed by Hibernate</strong>
              Would love to have a JDBC version backed with Hibernate.
